# LisPython
This documentation stands for version **{{ version }}**   
**Try LisPy without installing it! : [Web REPL](https://jethack23.github.io/lispy-web)**

## What is LisPython?
Lisp + Python = LisPython.   
I'll use the abbreviation **LisPy** throughout this documentation.
LisPy provides a new lisp-like syntax for Python. (Thus, macro system too)
   
LisPy is highly inspired by [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Hy](https://hylang.org/).
I started this project because I want something slightly different from Hy.
As a standalone language, Hy evolves fast.
It can be good in general.
But it's hard for me to keep track of the breaking changes in Hy.
