In this section, I'll give a pair of LisPy code and corresponding Python code for each AST node.
Checkout the [Python AST documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/ast.html#module-ast) for more information about each node.

Corresponding python code is generated by `l2py` command in [usage section](../usage/cli.md).

## example
LisPy Version
```python
(print "Hello, World!")
```
Python version
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
